Updates: 
Notes:

give priority to d_cache becuaes of edge case that has to do with read after load stall

forwading doesn't take care of: 
	auipc, go through every instruction and make sure you are taking into account all the values

need to do stalling


one instruction don't need to do read after ld stall:
str instructions
need a forwarding from output of mux to output of cache
